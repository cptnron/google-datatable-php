google-datatable-php
====================
This is a composer package for working with the Google DataTable format in PHP.

It probably doesn't work yet.  If you are looking for this functionality, check out the repo linked below.

It is ripped directly from [bggardner/google-visualization-php](https://github.com/bggardner/google-visualization-php) which is a port of [google-visualization-java](https://code.google.com/p/google-visualization-java/) but this repo only includes classes related to DataTables.
