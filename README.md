google-datatable-php
====================
This is a composer package for working with the Google DataTable format in PHP.  

It is ripped directly from [bggardner/google-visualization-php](https://github.com/bggardner/google-visualization-php) which is a port of [google-visualization-java](https://code.google.com/p/google-visualization-java/) but this repo only includes classes related to DataTables.
